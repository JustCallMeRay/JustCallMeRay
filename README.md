Hello, I’m Ray ✨ (@JustCallMeRay)
- I’m interested in game devlopment and technical art but have a love of all things code, maths and 
- I’m currently honning my skills as an experianced devloper and expanding into new specialisms to increase my abilities.
- I am avalible for hire and would love to collabarate on anything usign GPU/parrell compute. I have recently been looking at "web 3" style netcode (more UDP less watch the world burn) and thinking about how to check passwords with an "untrusted" server. 
- You can reach me by [email] :e-mail:, [reddit] or [twitter], I also have a [linktree] to contain everything and a backup incase my [website] goes down.
